# AI Agents Framework

The AI Agents Framework is a comprehensive Python-based toolkit for developing and managing intelligent agent systems. This repository provides modular components for creating AI-driven workflows, machine learning integration, and performance analytics in agent-based systems.

## Features

**Core Agent System**  
The `AI_Agent.py` module contains fundamental classes for agent instantiation, message passing, and decision-making processes. This core system supports both reactive and deliberative agent architectures through configurable behavior trees[1].

**Machine Learning Integration**  
Two specialized modules enable ML capabilities:
- `AI_agent_ml.py`: Implements supervised learning patterns for predictive analytics
- `AI_agent_ml_unsupervised.py`: Provides clustering and anomaly detection features

**Workflow Automation**  
The `AI_agent_workflow.py` module offers a DAG-based workflow engine with automatic task sequencing and dependency resolution. This system supports both sequential and parallel execution modes[1].

**Performance Monitoring**  
Real-time metrics collection and analysis through:
- `AI_Agent_Metrics.py`: Tracks 12 key performance indicators
- `workflow_metrics.json`: Stores historical performance data
